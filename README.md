# Multichannel ADC source based on Atmega 168

* In this project I used Atmel AVR microcontroller Atmega 168 and
16 x 2 LCD based on HD44780;

* The project implies external 8 MHz crystal resonator and Precision 5V Voltage Reference;

* The program written on C language in Atmel Studio 7 IDE;

* I've simulated program in Proteus VSM; 

* FUSEBIT's setted only in external 8MHz crystal oscillator
