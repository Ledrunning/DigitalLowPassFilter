# Low pass filter based on Atmega88
# Using one channel ADC source

* In this project I used Atmel AVR microcontroller Atmega 88 and
16 x 2 LCD based on HD44780;

* The project implies an external 8 MHz crystal resonator and Precision 5V Voltage Reference;

* The program is written in C language in Atmel Studio 7 IDE;

* I've simulated the program in Proteus VSM; 

* FUSEBIT's set only in external 8MHz crystal oscillator
